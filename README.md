## Development

To run Peel locally:

-   Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
-   Run `npm i` to install dependencies
-   Run `npm start` to start the development server, which should take you to `http://localhost:5173/` in your default browser

You probably won't, but if you need to run sharing capabilities locally:

-   Create an `.env` file with your S3 deets â€” see [`.env.example`](/.env.example)
-   Run `npm run start:functions` to run API functions locally

## Contributing

Interested in contributing? Sweet! Keep in mind that Peel is **intentionally simple**. It's easy to pick up and use, but also has some intricate features that don't bloat the interface.

-   [Open an issue](https://github.com/berkcebi/peel/issues) to propose a feature, an improvement or a fix.
    -   If you're proposing changes to the interface, try to include a rough mockup.
-   Create a pull request when ready â€” [link the PR to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue), if you are solving one.
